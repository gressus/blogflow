## How to translate to you lang
1. Search "kg" in whole project
2. Change in found .svelte files "kg" to your lang, add translation
3. Change all kg.md files in /static folder
4. Change in hooks.serve.js "kg" to your lang and your sites (for Domain-based i18n)
5. Change in LanguageToggle.svelte "KG" to your lang and your sites

## Domain-based i18n: site.com & site.kg
Default we have domain-based i18n. One domain is for one language, another domain is for another language.
"Change lang" button redirect from one domain to another.

## Path-based i18n: site.org/en & site.org/kg
If your want change type of i18n to path-based routing, plz, checkout to pathbased-i18n branch

## Todo
1. Optimize image loading
2. Different image size for preview and for full article
3. Translate project page
4. Move translations to separate t.js file, for more friedly start
~~5. (done) Add option to change lang via localstorage or via domain (/en)~~
6. Add option to full static pregeneration (only for domain-based i18n, because need change routing to /[lang]/)
7. Add supporting custom themes
~~8. (done) Now we have domain-based i18n, add git-branch to alternative i18n with path (/[lang]/)~~
9. Add meta-tag to all pages (not only for blog one)
